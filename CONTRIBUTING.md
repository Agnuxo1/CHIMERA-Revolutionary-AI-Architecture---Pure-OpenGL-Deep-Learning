## 📋 Contribution Guidelines

### Code Standards

**Python Style:**
```bash
# Use black for formatting
black chimera_v3/ examples/ tests/

# Sort imports
isort chimera_v3/ examples/ tests/

# Check for issues
flake8 chimera_v3/ --max-line-length=100

# Type checking
mypy chimera_v3/
```

**Documentation:**
- Use Google/NumPy style docstrings
- Keep comments concise but informative
- Update README files for user-facing changes
- Add examples for new features

**Testing:**
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain >90% test coverage
- Test on multiple GPU types when possible
