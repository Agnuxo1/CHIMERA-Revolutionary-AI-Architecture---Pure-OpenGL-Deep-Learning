Virtual environment tool (venv/conda)
```

**Clone and Setup:**
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Agnuxo1/CHIMERA-Revolutionary-AI-Architecture---Pure-OpenGL-Deep-Learning.git
cd CHIMERA-Revolutionary-AI-Architecture---Pure-OpenGL-Deep-Learning

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv chimera-dev
source chimera-dev/bin/activate  # Windows: chimera-dev\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

**Verify Setup:**
```bash
# Test OpenGL
python -c "import moderngl; print(moderngl.create_standalone_context().info)"

# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Check code style
flake8 chimera_v3/ --max-line-length=100
black --check chimera_v3/
mypy chimera_v3/
```
