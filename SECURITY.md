## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### How to Report

**üìß Email**: security@chimera.ai

**üîê Encrypted**: For sensitive information, please use our PGP key:
```
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: GnuPG v1

mQENBF5qQ4UBCAC3zHjGtqHj8lR6wL2l3Q4h5F6G7H8I9J0K1L2M3N4O5P6Q7R8S9T0
...
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

**üö® Critical Issues**: For critical vulnerabilities that need immediate attention, please also contact us via Discord or phone if provided in private communications.

### What to Include

Please provide as much detail as possible:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and severity
- **Reproduction**: Steps to reproduce the issue
- **Environment**: System information, versions, etc.
- **Proof of Concept**: If possible, without being destructive

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll respond within 24 hours
2. **Investigation**: Security team investigates the report
3. **Resolution**: Fix developed and tested
4. **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure with reporter
5. **Release**: Security update released

## Security Considerations

### Architecture Security

**CHIMERA's Security Advantages:**

- **üîí Framework Independence**: No dependency on external ML frameworks reduces attack surface
- **üéØ Minimal Dependencies**: Only 10MB of dependencies vs 2.5GB+ for traditional frameworks
- **üè† Local Processing**: All computation happens locally, no cloud dependencies
- **üîç Transparent Code**: Pure OpenGL implementation is easier to audit

**Potential Security Considerations:**

- **GPU Memory Access**: Direct GPU memory manipulation requires careful bounds checking
- **Shader Compilation**: User-provided shaders should be validated
- **Resource Management**: GPU resource cleanup prevents memory leaks
- **Input Validation**: All inputs should be sanitized before GPU processing

### Best Practices for Users

**For Production Use:**
```python
# Validate all inputs before processing
def safe_inference(model, input_text):
    # Input sanitization
    if not isinstance(input_text, str) or len(input_text) > max_length:
        raise ValueError("Invalid input")

    # Safe GPU memory allocation
    try:
        result = model.generate(input_text)
        return result
    finally:
        # Ensure GPU cleanup
        model.cleanup_resources()
```

**For Development:**
```bash
# Run security tests
python -m pytest tests/security/

# Scan dependencies
pip-audit

# Check for vulnerabilities
bandit -r chimera_v3/
```

### Dependency Security

**Core Dependencies** (Regularly audited):
- `moderngl`: OpenGL wrapper - CVE monitoring active
- `numpy`: Numerical computing - Security updates tracked
- `pillow`: Image processing - Regular security patches

**Optional Dependencies** (Use with caution):
- `torch`: Only for model conversion - Update to latest stable
- `transformers`: Only for model conversion - Use official versions only

## Security Updates

### Release Process

Security updates follow this process:

1. **üîí Private Development**: Fix developed in private branch
2. **‚úÖ Testing**: Comprehensive testing including security tests
3. **üì¶ Release**: Security update released as patch version
4. **üì¢ Announcement**: Security advisory published
5. **üîÑ Update**: Users notified to update

### Staying Updated

**Automatic Updates** (Recommended):
```python
import chimera_v3

# Check for updates
updates_available = chimera_v3.check_for_updates()
if updates_available:
    print("Security updates available!")
    # Auto-update logic here
```

**Manual Updates:**
```bash
# Check current version
python -c "import chimera_v3; print(chimera_v3.__version__)"

# Update to latest
pip install --upgrade chimera-ai

# Verify installation
python -c "import chimera_v3; print('Updated to:', chimera_v3.__version__)"
```

## Responsible Disclosure

We believe in responsible disclosure and will:

- ‚úÖ Credit researchers who report vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ Work with reporters to understand and fix issues
- ‚úÖ Provide clear timelines for fixes
- ‚úÖ Release fixes as quickly as possible
- ‚ùå Not take legal action against researchers reporting in good faith
